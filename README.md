Welcome to Dice Guesser, a simple Python-based dice guessing game!

## Description

In this game, you will have the opportunity to guess the outcome of a dice roll. The program will generate a random number between 1 and 6, simulating the roll of a six-sided dice. Your task is to guess the correct number and win the game.

## How to Play

1. Run the code in a Python environment.
2. The program will prompt you to enter your guess for the dice roll outcome.
3. Enter a number between 1 and 6 and press enter.
4. If your guess is out of range or not a valid number, the program will inform you and prompt for another guess.
5. The program will let you know if your guess is correct or incorrect.
6. If your guess is incorrect, the program will also reveal the actual dice roll outcome.
7. Keep guessing until you correctly guess the dice roll outcome.
8. Once you guess correctly, the program will display "YOU WIN" and the game will end.
9. The program will then show you the total number of guesses you made and the number of mistakes you committed during the game.

## Example

Here's an example of how the game would look in action:

```
Bazinga! dice rolled!!!
Enter your guess: 3
try again PC choice 6
Bazinga! dice rolled!!!
Enter your guess: 4

Bazinga! dice rolled!!!
